#+TITLE: Stochastic Operations Research


* Contents of the files and directories:
- ~stochastic-or.pdf~: the main text and exercises with hints and solutions.
- ~book-sources/~: latex source files for the book. There are many useful LaTeX things that you can learn from the LaTeX sources and the =preamble.sty=.
- ~code~/: the python code I discuss in the book.


* Typos and changes

Here is a list of things I changed in the files during the course. (I don't mention very simple typos, like spelling errors).
